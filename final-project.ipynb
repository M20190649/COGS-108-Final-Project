    "Emissions from vehicles have been adding to the everlasting modern-day problems of air pollution and traffic. The introduction of electric vehicles along with a greater emphasis placed on walking, biking, and/or using micro-mobility resources for transportation has reduced the impact to the growing gas emission problem as well as traffic congestion. However, there is still a reliance on vehicles to get people to their destinations, which is what rideshare services alleviate. These programs allow for multiple people to join a ride going in a similar destination, serving as a carpool, which saves gas, time, and money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people have contemplated either buying a car or just continuing to use rideshare options, especially when Uber and Lyft constantly promote their services with discount codes. New vehicles cost tens of thousand dollars, and research shows that cars are not even used 95% of the time(Barter). On average, a car is in usage for 6 out of the 168 hours of the week. This number is so small and on top of that the cost of owning a car continues to increase because of the maintenance, insurance, and the possibility of crashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rideshare programs such as Uber and Lyft are almost ubiquitous in our modern day world. Studies have shown that rideshare services have increased 37% from 1.9 billion to 2.61 billion people from 2016 to 2017. Both Uber and Lyft claim that one of their driving principles revolves around reducing traffic congestion through minimizing car ownership and usage. In urban cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, analyzing peak commute times would prove to be a sound indicator of whether these companies are alleviating the flow of traffic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate, we would analyze accumulated data about traffic patterns during peak commute times in densely populated cities since the onset of rideshare popularity. We would also look at specific usage trends with regards to rideshare program data to draw correlations. \n"

    "Most of our data was pulled from [Uber's Movement Dataset](https://movement.uber.com/?lang=en-US). Each row is the aggregated mean and standard deviation of travel time and geometric travel time over the course of each quarter in the fiscal year. Sources and destinations are determined by 'sourceid' and 'dstid'. We decided to choose the inner join of sources and destinations with over 10,000 rows as a source, and 5,000 as a destination. Furthermore we'd be tracking commute times so we'd be further filtering from rush hour in the Bay Area, all the time in San Francisco, but typically 7am - 10am and 3pm - 7pm."
